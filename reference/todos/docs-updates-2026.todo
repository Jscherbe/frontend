Todos:
  ☐ Finish the 2 plugins and swap them out in frontend then merge frontend and finish tabs  @next
    ☐ Merge branch into main 
  After Merge:
    ☐ Test deployed
      ☐ Test docs once Ulu updates are in place on github
      ☐ Test library build system since deps have been updated @important
    ☐ Make documentation more concise (directories, etc)
    ☐ Setup wrapper component for showing / rendering source code @later
      * This one is easy and just has to be done, do ulu updates and then do this last since it's not crucial but publishing updates is
    ☐ Remove this file and collapse project level todos into single todo file
      * Scss/Js can remain separate
