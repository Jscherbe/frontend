/pages/ --> ContentParser --> Tree for bundler --> 

About Tree:
  - Should include html (output)
  - Should include file sources (locally that should be bundled)
   # Idea: Keep in mind that it could be useful to allow outside sources to be collected
  - Should include the raw content? (I would say no, maybe there is a callback for users/debugging)
  - Should includes static HTML (not parsed by bundler?)
   # That's the snag is that the bundler shouldn't grab sources? Or should it (all unified)
   # - If that's the case the bundler needs to know the context to match sources from per element of the tree
  
Vocabulary:
  bundler: 
    - The thing that pulls html sources together
    - The thing that parses HTML
    - Where do page layouts go?
