## key Features

- **Target Environment:** The JavaScript "UI" modules are specifically tailored for traditional sites, such as static websites and CMS-driven platforms. However, the comprehensive SCSS modules are fully compatible and can be utilized in modern JavaScript applications built with frameworks like React or Vue.
- **Configuration & Consistency:** The system's main goal is to allow for highly flexible, per-site configuration while maintaining a consistent set of accessible and high-quality components.
- **Flexible Usage:** This library is designed as a toolkit, offering the flexibility to be used as a complete stylesheet solution or to pick and choose individual SCSS modules and components as needed.
- **Integration Adaptability:** All SCSS base selectors (for components, utilities, etc.) can be easily adjusted, making it highly adaptable for seamless integration into pre-existing systems and diverse development environments.
- API Documentation for both SCSS and JS with examples
