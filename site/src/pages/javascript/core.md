# core
Public API for the core modules.

This file re-exports the internal implementations from the `core` directory
with new names where appropriate, defining the public-facing API for the
library bundle.

For internal library usage, import directly from the specific file within
the `core` directory (e.g., `import { ... } from './settings.js'`).
