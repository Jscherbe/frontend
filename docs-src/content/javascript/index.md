Modules are broken into the following categories, they can be used individually or all together:

- **/js/index.js** - All modules combined
- **/js/events/** - Events module 
- **/js/ui/** - UI modules (a collection of javascript modules used for ui related needs). Some are useful in web app enviroments (ie. breakpoint) but most are for traditional web sites (not SPA). Use Vue library for versions of these designed for Vue SPA
- **/js/utils/** - Utilities that are used internally but may be useful outside of core in custom code
