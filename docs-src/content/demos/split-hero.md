title: Split Hero
layout: fullpage
intro: |
  Demos below show all available layouts. Position modifiers adjust the position of the hero graphic. A container class is required within content, as this only controls the outer layout. For example container-small is being used below. Note fill-context can be used on graphic container if you can't add a class directly to the img/video.
