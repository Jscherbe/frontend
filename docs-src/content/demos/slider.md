                  <p>The success of our state education system comes from our capacity to engage with stakeholders,
                    evaluate and recruit educators and leaders, connect fully with students and navigate technical
                    processes to gain and assess valuable data. Having a knowledgeable and capable partner like the
                    Region 5 Comprehensive Center greatly aids our goals of providing a thorough, high-quality, and
                    robust education to every child in West Virginia schools. Region 5 offers important resources,
                    training opportunities and collaborations that ensure we are able to meet our mission.</p>

                  <p>The Office of School Quality underwent a transformation in our support model with an increased
                    emphasis on collaboration and reflection. During those years, our Region 5 team helped us to expand
                    our village to ensure alignment with national models, while simultaneously building internal team
                    structures and stronger team dynamics.&nbsp;The Region 5 team has helped our team to refocus on
                    outcomes, and measurable results while continuing to build capacity internally and externally.&nbsp;
