Todos:
  ☐ Need to setup sass and js to have trailing commas
  ☐ Document where to locate and update the dist/ files for the docs, they are currently in the `docs-src/.vuepress/public` 
  ☐ Vuepress webpack version conflicts with mine

Other:
  ☐ Webpack Mixin needs to allow custom filename as entry. It should also consider using path.join vs path.resolve so that ".." can be used?
