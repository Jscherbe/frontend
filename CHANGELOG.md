# Change Log

## Version 0.0.6

### SCSS

- Added utils.map-merge($map, $changes, $mode)
  - This will allow expansion if needed and is simpler for modules to implement
  - This is to replace utils.map-merge-or-overwrite which is deprecated now
- Removed IE "*zoom" clearfix property as we don't support it and it causes errors in CSS minifiers since it's not standard CSS

### JS

- Add js docs
- Add specific exports for JS (ie. package "exports")
- All utils are moved to new independent module @ulu/utils and are implemented as submodules
  - Since these can be used outside of frontend workflow
  - Update imports to point to new module
- Move old waypoints code to deprecated, no longer needed with intersectionObserver
